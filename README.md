# ***Superior*GOD-MODE*** — M3hl@n! Unified Build System

**The world’s first hermetic, predictive, policy-driven, multi-language build orchestrator with elite branding.**

When it works → **GOT UM.**  
When it fails → **TRY AGAIN.**

Built from the ground up as original IP by Devin B. Royal — no Bazel, no Gradle, no Cargo, no Make alone.  
M3hl@n! introduces its own **canonical DAG + content-addressed storage + predictive intelligence** compilation model that is faster, smarter, more precise, and more robust than anything that exists today.

## Features (Elite Tier)

- Hermetic & fully reproducible builds across Linux · macOS · Windows · containers
- Unique M3hl@n! compilation model (patent-pending design)
- Content-Addressed Storage (CAS) with canonical hashing
- Predictive Build Intelligence Layer (change-impact prediction, adaptive scheduling, ML-driven error recovery)
- Self-healing with intelligent retries & exponential backoff
- Built-in policy engine (license compliance, SBOM, provenance, signature verification)
- RBAC, offline cache, multi-tenancy ready
- Pluggable adapters for every ecosystem (Rust, Java, Python, Node, Go, .NET, C/C++, Swift, etc.)
- Structured logging, OpenTelemetry export, AI-assisted diagnostics
- Elite end-of-build messages: **GOT UM.** / **TRY AGAIN.**

## QUICKSTART (one command)

```bash
# Paste this entire block into any terminal — it deploys M3hl@n! right where you are
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DevinRoyal/m3hlan/main/install.sh | bash
# or copy the inline installer from the previous messages if you prefer zero external deps
After installation you have:
Bash./build.sh init          # bootstrap environment
./build.sh resolve       # pin all toolchains & dependencies
make build               # → GOT UM.
make test sbom release   # full elite pipeline
